Greeting.

This is a record for a my work of a trading mining project during Dec in 2018.
Now the project is no longer profitable, so I put my code up here as a record.

In short, this project works based on Max exchange.
The profit can be split into two part - 1,Trading Reward and 2,Airdrop reward.

1.Trading Reward.
For any trade you made, the exchange will return 60% of the fee it required back to us through equivalent value of MAX coin.
In detail, it will the automatically make a market order to buy Max coin with the fee you paid when the order is completed.
The degree of it return will decline as the difficulty of Mining increase, and this project only can be profitalbe when it holds at 60%.

2.Airdrop Reward
At the end of the day, the exchange will return 80% of its net fee profit back to the user. 40% to maker, 10% to taker and 30% to holder.
Therefore, if you can become maker and taker at the same time, you can take 50% of fee back.
At this time, we do not consider the reward to holder, since it require continue holding coin. 
It can be more profitable if you "lock-in", but you have to endure the risk of price changing which we are not prefer.

So here is the strategy:

We become maker and taker at the same time, so for any trade we mad, we will get 60% of the fee back in Max now and 50% back at end of the day.
That will be 10% return for the fee we paid.
Since the profit is based on "fee", we need to make thousand of trade to get ideal profit. From my experience, 1000~2000 will be the best number.

Beside, MAX for trading reward are bought by market order immediately, so if the market do not have enough depth (it is), 
it will push up the Max price and increase our cost of MAX.
The solution to this point is just make a limit sell order right after the reward arrive, and remain some MAX at the end of the day.
Through doing this, when systme going to buy at market, our order will provide enough depth to protect the price pushing.
That is , we are taking the order buy ourselves (system buy at market <-> sell at limit, and the amount system bought will return to us).
